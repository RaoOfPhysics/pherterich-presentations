#Useful tools to use for analysis

* If you're working on statistical analyses, the library offers a wide range of training, e.g. for:
 - NVivo
 - SPSS
 - STATA
 - R & RStudio (recommended, because it is open!)
 
 All sessions are available for booking at https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/skills/digitaltechnologyskills/courselists/statistics.aspx
 
* Training on other scientific software is also available (Matlab) at https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/skills/digitaltechnologyskills/courselists/unixresearchcomputing.aspx
 
* If possible, use open software so others can work with your files (without content being lost) even if they don't have a subscription to the software.

* If you're working in a team, think about using systems for version control, such as Git. Git can be used as a command line tool or by using a web interface such as GitHub. Not familiar with Git? Make friends with :ocotocat: by taking the 15 minute introduction course: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 If you want to spend more time, check out CodeAcademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git

* GitHub can also be used as a collaboration tool (not only for collaborative coding)

* If you work with data and code and want to document all of it together (and possibly even share it), check out jupyter notebooks: https://jupyter.org/about.html
And maybe even create blog posts like this one: https://betatim.github.io/posts/really-interactive-posts/

**Discussion**
* What will you use? How open is it? Are there open alternatives?
