# Tools to track your impact

Impact is usually tracked with "classical bibliometrics" methods, such as a researcher's h-index or overall citation counts. 

An overview of bibliometrics is available at https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/services/research/bibliometrics-an-introduction.aspx and through a self enroll Canvas course: https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/enroll/TXTYRY

In addition to traditional citation counts, the digital age and the open science and social media platforms allow us to take a wider view at the impact of our work. Thus, in 2010, the idea of "altmetrics" came up.
The altmetrics manifesto is available here: http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/

Altmetrics use sources like:
* social media mentions (especially tweets)
* blogs
* wikipedia references
* Bookmarks in reference systems (Mendeley)

Examples: altmetric.com 
* can be implemented in platforms (such as zenodo etc.) as a badge
* as a researcher, you can use the altmetric bookmarklet (https://www.altmetric.com/products/free-tools/bookmarklet/) to get the impact for a single article
* explore the top 100 altmetric articles in 2015 (https://www.altmetric.com/top100/2015/#explore)

## Personal profiles to help with impact tracking and presentation

* ORCID - Open Researcher and Contributor ID
  * a unique lifetime identifier for you as a researcher that you can carry with you when changing institutions
  * can be linked to other identfiers, research outputs and can help to quickly exchange information between systems
  * "master record of your publication list"

* Impact story
  * collecting all the altmetrics for your publications (based on ORCID)
  * join for free with Twitter

* Google Scholar
  * providing personal metrics based on your output indexed in Google Scholar (articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites.)
  * creation of a profile needs a Google Account
  * public and private profiles
  * curated list of publications (and citation alerts based on them)
