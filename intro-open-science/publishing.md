# Where, (what) and when should you publish?

In addition to papers, you want to make share other material such as posters or slides you presented at conferences to disseminate your work as widely as possible and get feedback. You can use:
- the University's repository ubira (http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/)
- generic repositories such as Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) or figshare (https://figshare.com/)
- the RIO journal (research ideas and outcomes) http://riojournal.com/about#What-Can-I-Publish

If you want to publish Gold Open Access, you might want to check out
* PeerJ (which can be connected to Overleaf, https://peerj.com/)
* F1000 Research (mostly life science focus, https://f1000research.com/)

Some funders (such as Wellcome Trust) might actually encourage you to become more open and provide Open Research platforms powered by the technologies mentioned above (https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/).

PeerJ has a section on so called preprints. Preprints are the first version of your paper that you submit for peer review. In some disciplines, this is the main form of scientific communication (e.g. physics and the preprint server arXiv, https://arxiv.org/). 

It's important to not sign away copyright for your work when you publish! Try to publish your work under Creative Commons Licenses.

F1000 Research does the peer review process in the open and more and more journals add a comment function to their platforms. You could also review and annotate (for your own literature review) using hypothes.is (https://hypothes.is/).

A few examples to see these tools "in action":
* Hypothesis integrated into a conference presentation hosted on github: https://via.hypothes.is/https://raoofphysics.github.io/201608_ICHEP/
* F1000 Open Peer Review: http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.9050.2
