# Tools for collaborative writing

You might be familiar with Google Drive (former Google Docs), but there are more options to work collaboratively on a - usually - paper.

If you write your paper in LaTeX, you might want to have a look at Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) and ShareLaTeX (https://www.sharelatex.com/). 

Another option is to use authorea (https://www.authorea.com) where you can choose the following formats:
* MS Word/Office
* LaTeX
* MarkDown

All services can be used with


| Authorea | Overleaf | ShareLaTeX
--- | ------ | -------- | -----
Free version |  One project | up to 1 gb storage & 60 projects | one collaborator
GitHub integration | yes | yes (beta) | not in the free version
