# Tools for collaborative writing

You might be familiar with Google Drive (former Google Docs), but there are more options to work collaboratively on a - usually - paper.

If you write your paper in LaTeX, you might want to have a look at Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) and ShareLaTeX (https://www.sharelatex.com/). 

Another option is to use authorea (https://www.authorea.com) where you can choose the following formats:
* MS Word/Office
* LaTeX
* MarkDown

All services can be used with the most common journal templates and easily export to PDF for submission. They work with open reference systems. If you need help on referencing, contact your library subjext advisor or explore the library pages on bibliography training (https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/referencing/icite/software/index.aspx). You want to explore zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) and Mendeley (https://www.mendeley.com/) though as they have group features and allow the joint curation of a literature collection.


Feature | Authorea | Overleaf | ShareLaTeX
------- | ------ | -------- | -----
\# of projects| 1 project | up to 1 gb storage & 60 files per project | one collaborator
GitHub integration | yes | yes (beta) | not in the free version

It's recommended to explore several options and find the right tool for your needs.
